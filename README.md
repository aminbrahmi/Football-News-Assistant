Interactive web interface with live chat.

⚽ Loading spinner while processing requests.

🔹 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline

The assistant implements a RAG pipeline combining retrieval and generation:

1️⃣ Retrieval (R)

Fetch news articles from NewsAPI.

Convert articles into embeddings with SentenceTransformer.

Store embeddings in a FAISS index for fast similarity search.

Encode the user query and retrieve the most relevant articles.

2️⃣ Augmented Generation (AG)

Format retrieved articles as context for the AI model.

Mistral generates a concise, factual answer.

If the query is not in English, it is translated automatically to English before retrieval.

3️⃣ Output

The generated answer is translated back (if needed) to the user’s language.

Sources are displayed in bold.

The ⚽ spinner is shown while the assistant is generating a response.
